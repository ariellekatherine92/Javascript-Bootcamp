// Exercise 1
// Run this portion of code and walk through the steps of each loop
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}


// Now you try, write a for loop that will print out the numbers 1 - 100







// Exercise 2
// Set a new variable to value of an array


// Print out the third item in the array
let breakfast = ['eggs', 'milk', 'cereal', 'orange'];


// Set a new variable to the last value of the "breakfast" array
// Use the .length - 1 method to get the last item of the array



// Loop through the array, "breakfast", and log each value within the array








// Exercise 3
// Set a new variable to a vlue of an object


// Print out the "color" value of the "car"
let car = {
    color: "blue", 
    hp: 123,
    year: 1999
};

// Set a new key called "model" on the "car" object, set it with any value


// Print out the value you just created


// Loop through the car object with a "for...in loop" and log each key and value
